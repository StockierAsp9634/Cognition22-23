# Cognition FTC 2021-2022

This is FTC team Cognition #19655's repository for our code for this year. The IP Address of the robot: 192.168.43.1

## How to Update the Repository

Updating the repository is going to help us manage version control this year. Essentially, every change made at our Sunday practices will be uploaded from the respective computer that it was made on to this repository, and Github enables any team member to be able to see the changes whenever they want from their own computers. 

However, in order to avoid messing up the code too much, it is imperative that we make sure to follow some procedures. 

### Using the Right Folder

We are using the cloned FTC SDK, which means that a lot of the folders are extremely important and should not be touched. **The only folder that should be edited at all is the [Team Code folder](https://github.com/Team-Cognition/FTC_2021-2022/tree/Arnav-Changes/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc), and the rest of it should be left completely alone**. 

### Pull Requests

Use a [pull request](https://github.com/Team-Cognition/FTC_2021-2022/pulls) ; don't immediately put everything onto the main branch. This is what Github is for, if there is ever an error in the new code we can go back to the main branch. Essentially, what pull requests do is create another branch of code that has changes, that are separate from the main code. If the entire team agrees and the code has been reviewed, we can then "push" the code into the main branch. However, this should not be done immediately. Reeve can go over how to create pull requests in depth because I believe Github is what he is supposed to research. 

### Comments

As well, if you think there is something wrong with some code, open an Issue in the [Issues](https://github.com/Team-Cognition/FTC_2021-2022/issues)'s tab of the repo. This functions like a comment on Google Docs; another programmer can see the issue and try to fix it. This will also help us keep track of what is going wrong and what we need to change. 

As well, you can comment on individual pull requests when they are made, to identify problems there as well. Comments are key to our collaboration this season. 

Happy programming!
